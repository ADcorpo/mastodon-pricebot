# mastodon-pricebot

This is a quick'n'dirty solution to update a Mastodon account with the price of a cryptocurrency.

## How to use it

This is a work in progress. Usage will change as I experiment.

## What the hell this is horrible

I experiment some weird decisions in this project to see if they would
be viable in practice. For example, I don't rely on
pip/setuptools/whatever, the only form of dependency management you'll
see is the git submodules that are integrated in the repo.

Also, all the logic is currently hardcoded because I wanted the bot to
work for me, but everything will soonâ„¢ be configurable, from the
currency you're tracking to the message that gets posted by the bot.

Just wait until I have some time

I swear

Look there's ludum dare 38 this week-end, everything will look nice
and shiny after that

Please
